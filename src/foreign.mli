(** High-level bindings for C functions and values *)

val foreign : ?from:Dl.library -> string -> ('a -> 'b) Ctypes.fn -> ('a -> 'b)
(** [foreign name typ] exposes the C function of type [typ] named by [name] as
    an OCaml value.  The argument [?from], if supplied, is a library handle
    returned by {!Dl.dlopen}.  *)

val foreign_value : ?from:Dl.library -> string -> 'a Ctypes.typ -> 'a Ctypes.ptr
(** [foreign_value name typ] exposes the C value of type [typ] named by [name]
    as an OCaml value.  The argument [?from], if supplied, is a library handle
    returned by {!Dl.dlopen}.  *)

val funptr : ?name:string -> ('a -> 'b) Ctypes.fn -> ('a -> 'b) Ctypes.typ
(** Construct a function pointer type from a function type.

    The ctypes library, like C itself, distinguishes functions and function
    pointers.  Functions are not first class: it is not possible to use them
    as arguments or return values of calls, or store them in addressable
    memory.  Function pointers are first class, and so have none of these
    restrictions. *)

val funptr_opt : ('a -> 'b) Ctypes.fn -> ('a -> 'b) option Ctypes.typ
(** Construct a function pointer type from a function type.

    This behaves like {!funptr}, except that null pointers appear in OCaml as
    [None]. *)

exception CallToExpiredClosure
(** A closure passed to C was collected by the OCaml garbage collector before
    it was called. *)
