(** The core ctypes module.

    The main points of interest are the set of functions for describing C
    types (see {!types}) and the set of functions for accessing C values (see
    {!values}).  The {!Foreign.foreign} function uses C type descriptions
    to bind external C values.

(** {4:pointer_types Pointer types} *)

type ('a, 'b) pointer = ('a, 'b) Ctypes_static.pointer
(** The type of pointer values. A value of type [('a, [`C]) pointer] contains
    a C-compatible pointer, and a value of type [('a, [`OCaml]) pointer]
    contains a pointer to a value that can be moved by OCaml runtime. *)

(** {4 C-compatible pointers} *)

type 'a ptr = ('a, [`C]) pointer
(** The type of C-compatible pointer values.  A value of type [t ptr] can be
    used to read and write values of type [t] at particular addresses. *)

type 'a ocaml = 'a Ctypes_static.ocaml
(** The type of pointer values pointing directly into OCaml values.
    {b Pointers of this type should never be captured by external code}.
    In particular, functions accepting ['a ocaml] pointers must not invoke
    any OCaml code. *)

(** {4 C array types} *)

type 'a carray = 'a Ctypes_static.carray
(** The type of C array values.  A value of type [t carray] can be used to read
    and write array objects in C-managed storage. *)

(** {4 Bigarray types} *)

type 'a bigarray_class = 'a Ctypes_static.bigarray_class
(** The type of Bigarray classes.  There are four instances, one for each of
    the Bigarray submodules. *)

(** {3 Struct and union types} *)

type ('a, 'kind) structured = ('a, 'kind) Ctypes_static.structured
(** The base type of values representing C struct and union types.  The
    ['kind] parameter is a polymorphic variant type indicating whether the type
    represents a struct ([`Struct]) or a union ([`Union]). *)

type 'a structure = ('a, [`Struct]) structured
(** The type of values representing C struct types. *)

type 'a union = ('a, [`Union]) structured
(** The type of values representing C union types. *)

type ('a, 't) field = ('a, 't) Ctypes_static.field
(** The type of values representing C struct or union members (called "fields"
    here).  A value of type [(a, s) field] represents a field of type [a] in a
    struct or union of type [s]. *)

type 'a abstract = 'a Ctypes_static.abstract
(** The type of abstract values.  The purpose of the [abstract] type is to
    represent values whose type varies from platform to platform.

    For example, the type [pthread_t] is a pointer on some platforms, an
    integer on other platforms, and a struct on a third set of platforms.  One
    way to deal with this kind of situation is to have
    possibly-platform-specific code which interrogates the C type in some way
    to help determine an appropriate representation.  Another way is to use
    [abstract], leaving the representation opaque.

    (Note, however, that although [pthread_t] is a convenient example, since
    the type used to implement it varies significantly across platforms, it's
    not actually a good match for [abstract], since values of type [pthread_t]
    are passed and returned by value.) *)

(** If [p] and [q] are pointers to elements [i] and [j] of the same array then

    {!make}) then unless the caller retains a reference to [p], the object may
    be collected, invalidating the returned address. *)

  (** [constant name typ] retrieves the value of the compile-time constant
      [name] of type [typ].  It can be used to retrieve enum constants,
      #defined values and other integer constant expressions.

      The type [typ] must be either an integer type such as [bool], [char],
      [int], [uint8], etc., or a view (or perhaps multiple views) where the
      underlying type is an integer type.

      When the value of the constant cannot be represented in the type there
      will typically be a diagnostic from either the C compiler or the OCaml
      compiler.  For example, gcc will say

         warning: overflow in implicit constant conversion *)

  val enum : string -> ?typedef:bool ->
    ?unexpected:(int64 -> 'a) -> ('a * int64 const) list -> 'a typ
  (** [enum name ?unexpected alist] builds a type representation for the
      enum named [name].  The size and alignment are retrieved so that the
      resulting type can be used everywhere an integer type can be used: as
      an array element or struct member, as an argument or return value,
      etc.

      The value [alist] is an association list of OCaml values and values
      retrieved by the [constant] function.  For example, to expose the enum

        enum letters \{ A, B, C = 10, D \}; 

      you might first retrieve the values of the enumeration constants:

      {[
        let a = constant "A" int64_t
        and b = constant "B" int64_t
        and c = constant "C" int64_t
        and d = constant "D" int64_t
      ]}

      and then build the enumeration type

      {[
        let letters = enum "letters" [
           `A, a;
           `B, b;
           `C, c;
           `D, d;
        ] ~unexpected:(fun i -> `E i)
      ]}

      The [unexpected] function specifies the value to return in the case
      that some unexpected value is encountered -- for example, if a
      function with the return type 'enum letters' actually returns the
      value [-1].

      The optional flag [typedef] specifies whether the first argument,
      [name], indicates an tag or an alias.  If [typedef] is [false] (the
      default) then [name] is treated as an enumeration tag:

        [enum letters { ... }]

      If [typedef] is [true] then [name] is instead treated as an alias:

(** {2 Exceptions} *)

exception Unsupported of string
(** An attempt was made to use a feature not currently supported by ctypes.
    In practice this refers to attempts to use an union, array or abstract
    type as an argument or return type of a function. *)

exception ModifyingSealedType of string
(** An attempt was made to modify a sealed struct or union type
    description.  *)

exception IncompleteType
(** An attempt was made to compute the size or alignment of an incomplete
    type.

    The incomplete types are struct and union types that have not been sealed,
    and the void type.

    It is not permitted to compute the size or alignment requirements of an
    incomplete type, to use it as a struct or union member, to read or write a
    value of the type through a pointer or to use it as the referenced type in
    pointer arithmetic.  Additionally, incomplete struct and union types
    cannot be used as argument or return types.

type uncoercible_info
exception Uncoercible of uncoercible_info
(** An attempt was made to coerce between uncoercible types.  *)
