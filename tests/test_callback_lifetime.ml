     that involves converting an OCaml function ("arg") to a C function
     pointer and back to an OCaml function ("ret"), there are potential
     problems with memory management.  More precisely, ret holds a reference
     to a C/libffi closure, which in turn holds a reference to arg that is not
     visible to the GC.  We'd like to ensure that arg is not collected before
     ret is called, which requires that we store ret and arg together.  This
     test demonstrate the behaviour of naive and more careful
